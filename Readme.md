Possible improvements
---------------------

1. The Repository wasn't very explicit. More information could have been given, as in contrast the service was very detailed down the methods and implementations.
2. Entities for example, such as Address and Name, needed to have some type of given Primary Key or Composite Key for the creation of entities.
3. The JpaRepository was not efficient nor usable within this specific assignment, since testing a service that is supposed to be null will only give NullPointerExceptions.
Thus implementation was necessary for the Repositories and ties in with Question 3, not being explicit enough to be answered correctly.
